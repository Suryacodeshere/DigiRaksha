        "category": "security"
    },
    {

        "question": "How can I confirm if the money has reached the right person?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can I cancel a UPI payment after sending it?",

        "category": "privacy"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can someone misuse my bank account number if I share it?",

    {
        "question": "What are fake job or part-time work scams involving payments?",
