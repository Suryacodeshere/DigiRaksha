## üöÄ Getting Started

### Backend (AI Model) Setup

This project now includes an optional Python backend that loads your XGBoost model from `C:\\Users\\ayush\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\xgb_fraud_model.joblib` and provides an API used by the UPI Checker.

Steps:
1. Open a terminal and go to `backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server: `python app.py` (or run `start_server.bat` on Windows)

The API runs on http://localhost:5000 and exposes:
- `GET /health`
- `POST /predict-fraud` with payload: `{ "upi_id": "example@paytm" }`
- `GET /model-info`

The frontend will gracefully continue to work even if the backend is down.

### Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

Create an optional `.env` in the project root to configure backend URL (if different):

```
VITE_MODEL_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
```

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open your browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
